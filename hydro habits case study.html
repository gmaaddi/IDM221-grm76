            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>The goal of this Interaction Design project was to pitch an idea for a new mobile application and demonstrate through animation how users can complete the core task that is intended for the app. </b>
                    The proposed app is called Hydro Habits, which helps users set hydration goals, choose from various types of drinks, and track their water intake. Hydro Habits also calculates the water content in each drink users consume, helping them on their way to achieving their hydration goal. 
                    <b>Users’ core task is to record drinks to fulfill their set hydration goals.</b>

            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    To better understand what is typical of a water hydration app, the research process included downloading thirteen different hydration apps from the App Store. Analyzing these different applications revealed the possible actions for users, how users go about performing these actions, and common imagery, including water glasses, water droplets, and water bottles.

            <h2>Sketching Design Ideas</h2>
                <p>
                    Through ideation and iteration, <b>30 unique ideas</b> were sketched to imagine how each screen in the app would appear.
                    <b>The sketches focused on the idea of a water-like aesthetic for the app, introducing variations with water glasses, water droplets, drink icons, bubbles, and curves to simulate waves.</b> 
                    Also considered in this sketching process was what information was necessary to display on each screen in addition to the placement of this information.
                    <b>Ultimately, water glasses, drink, icons, bubbles, and curves were incorporated into the final design.</b>

            <h2>Typography, Iconography, and Color Palette</h2>
                <p>
                    Oswald is the primary font used throughout the Hydro Habits app since the text is easy to read on small devices. This is important because the font can be used to convey important information. Fredoka One was also selected since it is a rounded font that imitates bubble letters, which fits the water-like aesthetic of the app. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The color palette consists of different shades of blue to fit the water-like aesthetic. Brighter colors were also introduced to provide contrast among areas with large amounts of blue.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the drink icons were created (using the pen tool in Figma), additional colors were implemented to accompany each drink icon. The colors for each drink differ from the other drink icons, allowing each drink icon to stand out with the color commonly associated with it.

            <h2>Sketching Microinteractions</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>30 sketches of possible interactions were made, including the appearance of the screen before a user performs an action and what would happen next,</b> whether it is a certain movement, color change on the screen, or transition to a new screen. Each of these sketches was organized by which part of the users’ process that they fit: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add Drink</li>
                        <li>Select Drink</li>
                        <li>Add Preset Amount</li>

            <h2>Wireframes and Wireflows</h2>
                <p>
                    Next, the best sketch ideas were chosen to develop into wireframes. <b>The wireframes were then used to create a wire flow, indicating which elements triggered a transition to a new screen.</b> 
                    From the home screen, users can tap the plus button, which transitions to a new page to select a drink. On the Select Drink screen, users can either add a recently selected drink, which will return them to an updated home screen, or select from the drinks featured prominently in the middle of the screen. If one of the prominently featured drinks is selected, the user will be taken to the Add Drink screen. To complete the process of adding a drink, the check button must be tapped. At this point, the user will either receive a notification that they met their hydration goal or they will be returned to the home screen with the updated hydration total and appearance of the drink they just added in the “Today’s Drinks” section.

                <p>
                    <b>At this step, the color palette was applied, and the drink icons were implemented.</b> 
                    Also, gradients were applied to the overlay at the top of the screen and several buttons. The gradients were introduced to make the buttons appear more clickable and enhance the visual appeal of the app, as they did with the gradient fills of the drink icons.

                    <b>The high-fidelity designs were then used to create an IX flow, which outlined the triggers, feedback, rules, and possible modes</b>
                    for each possible action that a user could perform that would align with their core task to record drinks to fulfill their hydration goal. 
                    <b>The IX flow also determined which actions would be necessary to demonstrate in the animation process.</b> 
                    Adding a recent drink and swiping horizontally to select additional drinks were not included in the final animation, but they were included in the IX flow since these actions could be performed and still align with users’ core task.

            <h2>Interaction Guides</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>The interaction guides provided detailed descriptions of which animations occurred on each screen and how they would appear once animated. Major animation decisions were made in this stage,</b> such as the appearance of the preset amount bubbles and how the bubbles would transition in and out when the goal message appears. For the preset amount bubbles, the goal was to find a solution that made the selected preset amount have more emphasis than the other preset amounts, but the struggle was finding a way to make the other bubbles appear clickable at a lower opacity. 
                    <b> It was ultimately decided that the selected preset amount bubble would have black text, and the other bubbles would appear at 75% opacity with blue text.</b>
                    For the goal message animation, the goal was to find a way for the check button to be noticeable on a screen where small bubbles would continuously float upwards, which could be distracting when looking for a specific button. Removing the check mark entirely was considered, and in this case, users would tap the message bubble to make the bubbles disappear. While this idea was not chosen,
                    <b>it led to the idea to attach the check button to the message bubble since it would be prominently featured in the center of the screen and the bubbles would float behind it.</b>

            <h2>Animation Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The completed designs were then transferred from Figma to Adobe After Effects where the interaction process could be animated.
                    <b>After one week, the core animations were blocked out, but the timing was inconsistent throughout and too fast to see everything that was on a screen.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since the first draft of animations was a long, complex file, it was easier to start with a blank document and use the first draft as a reference for which items needed to be animated.
                    <b>Consistent timing was established</b> after the second week <b>by keeping a notebook including the frame numbers where elements appeared and disappeared from view and the length of these animations.</b>
                    The second draft also <b>introduced a bubble popping sound effect when the message bubble shrinks to simulate the bubble popping.</b>
                </p>
        </div>

        <div class="subtopic">
            <h2>Final Animation</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Minor changes were made before the final animation, focusing on when certain elements animate in relation to others.</b>
                    It was determined that numbers should appear immediately in the glass before the water moves up in the glass on the Add Drink screen. Also, when selecting a preset amount, the number in the glass should change before the opacity and color changes of the preset amount bubbles. Finally, when the text and the drinks appear on the Select Drink screen, the timing was altered to ensure that the text landed in place when the drink icons had already finished their transition. All of these decisions were made to ensure that users would not have to wait to perform certain actions. For example, users can now tap on the check mark button before the water glass animation finishes and select a drink icon without having to wait for the rest of the text on the page to appear.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The completed Hydro Habits project demonstrates how users can go about completing a simple task through a simple design. 
                    <b>Much consideration was given to how the water-like aesthetic could aid in the users’ interaction with the application.</b>
                    Selecting a drink icon would cause the drink to shake with the liquid shifting accordingly, adding ounces of water would cause the water to fill the glass to a certain amount, and small bubbles floated in a seemingly random formation while a larger bubble popped. This proposed application stands out from other applications due to its intentional use of water-like imagery with natural, accompanying water-like actions. 
                    <b>The complex animations ultimately enhance the users’ experience without complicating how the users go about performing the actions that align with their task to record drinks to fulfill their hydration goal.</b>
