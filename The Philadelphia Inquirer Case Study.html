    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> delivers online news and two daily newspapers to the Philadelphia region. The content provided by <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> contains up-to-date, diverse, and reliable content that reaches a large audience. <b>The goal of this User Interface Design project was to redesign <i>The Inquirer’s</i> homepage and one article page and ensure its compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.</b>
        </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
            A user persona was created to represent the target audience.

    <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
            A heuristic evaluation was created to identify the strengths and weaknesses of <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> website according to the rating scale below.
        </p>

    <h2>Immediate Goals</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Improving upon screen density, organization, and layout will be imperative to improving the current <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> website.</b>
            These priorities were established upon completing the heuristic analysis. The Inquirer contains a large number of articles, but the current layout of this information on the homepage makes it difficult for users to find their desired information. 
            <b>Therefore, the redesign will aim to condense information on the homepage and provide clearly visible categories.</b>
        </p>

    <h2>Sketching</h2>
        <p>
            Eight layout options were sketched for both the redesigned homepage and article page, showcasing the layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
        </p>

        <h3>Homepage Sketches</h3>

            />

        <h3>Article Page Sketches</h3>

            width="480"

            />
    
            <img src="images/inquirer_articlesketches5-8.jpg" alt="inquirer article sketches 5-8"
            width="480"
            height="436"
            />

    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>
            Several ideas and design elements from the sketching phase were incorporated into the final proposed redesign of <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer website.</i>
            <b>For example, thin lines were implemented to make the website appear clean, modern, and professional. </b>
            Other design ideas, including vertical category titles alternating sides and left side navigation on the desktop, were also incorporated into the final redesign. 
            <b>The vertical category titles accompanied by thin lines were used to guide the readers’ eyes down the page and make it easier for them to find the articles and categories they would like to find.</b>
            Also implemented was left side navigation on the desktop screen. 
            <b>This navigation layout fit well with the desktop design since it was prominently featured when the users landed on a page and filled in a space that could have been otherwise blank.</b>
        </p>

    <h2>Typography, Iconography, and Color Styles</h2>
        <img src="images/inquirer_fontscolors.jpg" alt="inquirer fonts icons colors"
        width="480"
        height="220.2"
        />
    
        <p>
            Proxima Nova and Times were the two fonts selected for the redesign.
            <b>Proxima Nova was chosen because it could be used for article titles and categories,</b> making these areas stand out on the website. 
            <b>Times was chosen for article text</b> since Serif fonts are commonly used in physical newspapers, thus giving the redesigned website an <b>authentic newspaper feel.</b>
            Proxima Nova and Times were <b>ideal font choices since they are easily readable across different screen sizes and pair well together.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Universally recognized icons with a similar style were implemented in the redesigned <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> website.</b>
            These icons allow users to access additional items under the hamburger menu, visit <i>The Inquirer’s</i> social media pages, share <i>Inquirer</i> articles on social media, search for information on the website, and share information via email or copying a link.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>The color palette,</b> consisting of black, white, gray, and shades of blue and red, <b> was selected to add color to the primarily monochromatic Inquirer website.</b>
            The darker shades of red and blue were used for category titles and thin lines to provide emphasis and contrast in areas with black text. Lighter shades of blue and red were introduced for hover states of certain buttons.
            <b>This simple color palette maintains the website’s professional appearance while introducing colors associated with the city of Philadelphia;</b>  red and blue both appear in logos of two professional Philadelphia sports teams in addition to several Philadelphia websites.
        </p>

    <h2>Final Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
        <p>   
            A final peer-reviewed heuristic evaluation was created following the completion of <i>The Inquirer</i> prototype. <b>Task Orientation, Trust and Credibility, and Visual Design</b> were all key areas that were improved upon in the final prototype.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The most significant challenges</b> of this project were <b>making it easier to navigate the website, strategically placing advertisements, and creating an identity</b> for <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> website that stays true to its reputation as a trustworthy source. 
            The high-fidelity design has made the website easier to navigate and quickly scroll through by providing categories for each group of articles and using thin lines to guide users’ eyes in the direction of the corresponding articles. The user experience will also be improved through the reduced number of ads and placement in areas that do not disrupt reading the website’s content. Finally, the high-fidelity design expands the color palette of
            <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> website while remaining true to its professional appearance.
