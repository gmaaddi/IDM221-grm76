    <h1>About Me</h1>


<body>
<p>
I am a student in the User Experience and Interaction Design program at Drexel University. During my time at Drexel, I have worked on several projects both individually and in teams, which have taught me the value of ideation, iteration, and designing with the end user in mind.
</p>

<p>
I am passionate about conducting research and using this knowledge to design positive, user-friendly experiences. I love the analytical approach that is found in research, which is important to the end result of a project. Without a good understanding of the target audience in the early stages, a design may not succeed. I like that the research provides logic that can later be used to defend design decisions.
</p>

<p>
I am an incredibly driven and detail-oriented individual, which has been reflected by my endeavors of recent years. In 2020, I became a freelance podcast editor, which gave me experience in completing individual work and presenting the work to a client. In 2021, I opened a Redbubble shop, which strengthened my skills with design software and gave me experience in marketing my designs.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I enjoy crafting, baking, watching sports, and volunteering. I have also implemented meditation into my daily routine to improve my concentration. By making time for these activities, I have discovered that I am able to return to projects with a sharper and clearer mind.
